# Sming project skeleton

This repository has all the bits to make start of any [Sming](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming) based project. To use it with Visual Studio Code make sure you have both `ESP_HOME` and `SMING_HOME` environment variables set properly or VSCode C/C++ extension will not find included modules. After copying to your project environment uncomment relevant bits in `.gitignore` to make it tick.

* VS Code [C/C++ extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools) integration
* Intellisense with help of GNU Global tools provided by [C++ Intellisense extension](https://github.com/austin-----/code-gnu-global)
